      <h2>What basically is Recursion ??
      </h2> ..Huh ...actually its a function calling itself !!  Okay that might sound weird .. 
      lets take an example ...<br />
    function (param1 ,param2) <br />
       //do something with this params ...in normal function<br />
       for a recursive function .. we do something on those params and call the changed params again through the function ..inside it 

       <br />
        <img src="funcion image"></img>
        <br />
        so what is this function actaully doing ...







    </div>
  )
}

export default Rec
